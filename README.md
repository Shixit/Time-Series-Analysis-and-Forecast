# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecast
This is a project that performs Time Series Analysis on the given airline passenger  dataset and estimate the number of airport passengers expected to be in the  future with time series forecasting.
Steps and Methods:
 Missing Value Treatment (Mean Imputation, Linear Interpolation, Checking Outliers)
 Time Series Decomposition (Additional TSD, Multiplicative TSD)
 Simple Time Series Forecast Methods (Naive Method, Simple Average Method, Simple Moving Average Method)
 Exponential Smoothing Methods (Simple ESM, Holts Method with trend, Holt Winters' additive method with trend and seasonality, Holt Winter's multiplicative method with trend and seasonality)
 Auto- Regressive Methods
 Moving average method (MA)
 Auto regression moving average method (ARMA)
 Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
 Seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)
 Seasonal auto regressive integrate moving average with exogenous variable (SARIMAX)

We also calculated RMSE(Root-Mean-Squared-Error) and MAPE(Mean-Absolute-Percentage-Error) for each method to know which one works best for our dataset and also did Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test & Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test to check whether our time series is stationary or not!
